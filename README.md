# OCP Preparation

This project shows some basic Code examples needed for the OCP exam.
It is separated into packages that represent the chapters in the OCP book.

## Chapter 4 - Functional Programming
### Functional interfaces
The package *'funcinterfaces'* shows the common functional interfaces
that were added with Java8 to the *java.util.function* package with simple use cases.

| Functional Interfaces | #Parameters | Return Type | Single Abstract Method |
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Supplier&lt;T>           | 0            | T           | get                    |
| Consumer&lt;T>           | 1 (T)        | void        | accept                 |
| BiConsumer<T, U>      | 2 (T, U)     | void        | accept                 |
| Predicate&lt;T>          | 1 (T)        | boolean     | test                   |
| BiPredicate<T, U>     | 2 (T, U)     | boolean     | test                   |
| Function<T, R>        | 1 (T)        | R           | apply                  |
| BiFunction<T, U, R>   | 2 (T, U)     | R           | apply                  |
| UnaryOperator&lt;T>      | 1 (T)        | T           | apply                  |
| BinaryOperator&lt;T>     | 2 (T, T)     | T           | apply                  |

### Optional
The Optional type was also added with Java 8. It can be used to express "we don't know" or "not applicable".
An Optional is like a Box that might have a value inside or might be empty. 
Returning an Optional is a clear statement in the API that there might not be a value in there. 
This also avoids null values and NPE's.

The basics are shown inside the *'optional'* package.


### Streams
A stream is a sequence of data. 
Streams are comparable with an assembly line in a factory
A Stream consists of 3 parts:
* 1 Source: Where the stream comes from
* 0..n Intermediate operations: Transforms the stream into another one.
Since streams use lazy evaluation, the intermediate operations do not run until the terminal operation runs
* 1 Terminal operation: Actually produces a result. Streams can only be used once. The stream is no longer
valid after a terminal operation completes.

Source --> Intermediate operations --> Output from terminal operation

---
Generally the flow is like this: 
1. Elem 1 gets passed from the Source to intermediate operation 1
2. Elem 1 gets passed from intermediate operation 1 to intermediate operation 2 (and so on for all intermediate operations)

However, there are exceptions: e.g. the intermediate operation *sorted()* needs all elements of the stream to work.

Examples are shown in the *'streams'* package.



| Method                              | What happens for Infinite Streams? | Return Value | Reduction |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| count()                             | Does not terminate                 | long         | Yes       |
| min()/ max()                        | Does not terminate                 | Optional&lt;T>  | Yes       |
| findAny()/ findFirst()              | Terminates                         | Optional&lt;T>  | No        |
| allMatch()/ anyMatch()/ noneMatch() | Sometimes terminates               | boolean      | No        |
| forEach()                           | Does not terminate                 | void         | No        |
| reduce()                            | Does not terminate                 | Varies       | Yes       |
| collect()                           | Does not terminate                 | Varies       | Yes       |


## Primitive Streams
The package 'primitivestreams' shows how to use primitive streams.

There are 3 types of primitive streams in Java:
1. **IntStream** - Used for int, short, byte and char
1. **LongStream** - Used for long
1. **DoubleStream** - Used for double and float

These primitive Streams have the regular Stream methods + convenience methods for common tasks such as calculating an average.
 
There are Mapping methods to map a stream to another Stream type (This is the case for all Streams - Stream, IntStream, LongStream, DoubleStream)

There are special functional Interfaces for the primitive Streams. They are the equivalent to the general functional Interfaces we thematized in the package 'funcinterfaces'
- IntSupplier
- IntConsumer
- IntPredicate
- IntFunction
- IntUnaryOperator
- IntBinaryOperator
- (Same for Long and Double)

The type name tells us what primitive type is involved. 
 
### Optional with primitive Streams
There are 3 types of Optional primitives
1. OptionalInt
1. OptionalLong
1. OptionalDouble

The difference to a regular Optional is that a regular Optional such as `Optional<Double>` is for the Double wrapper class whereas the OptionalDouble is for the primitive double.

## Working with advanced Stream Pipeline Concepts
This chapter is in the 'advancedstreamconcepts' package.

The class `AdvancedStreamPipeline` contains the following topics:

Contains an example that proves that Streams are lazily evaluated.
Shows that some of the intermediate operations for Streams are also available for Optional.
Points out the problematic with checked Exceptions and Functional Interfaces.

The class `CollectingResults` Shows many predefined collectors. (Remember that Collectors are used in the terminal operation `collect()`)
It includes `joining()`, `averagingInt()`, `toCollection()`, `toMap()`, `groupingBy()` and`partitioningBy()`
